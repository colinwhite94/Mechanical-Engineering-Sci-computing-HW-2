Square Root. This program asks if you want to take a square root. It then asks for what number you want to take the square root of. It finds the square root by adding powers of ten until the answer is too big then it subtracts enough to get below the correct answer, and adds powers of ten that are one order of magnitude smaller than the previous step.  It then askes if you want to take another square root
